  <section class='slide'>
    <h2>Command Objects</h2>
    <h3>Backed by ActiveModel</h3>
    <p>A good first-approximation of good design is to make sure that your
    controllers don't directly interact with your persistence layer (or do so as
    minimally as possible).  I like to do this by defining Command objects for
    my controllers to collaborate with.</p>

    <h2>The old busted way</h2>
    <p>It's a webapp, so we're going to have a form on a webpage to take in user
    input.  That's going to submit to a controller.  The controller might look
    like:</p>
  </section>

  <section class='slide'>
    <pre>
      <code lang=ruby>
class TransfersController &lt; LoggedInController
  def create
    credit_manager = CreditManager.new
    student = current_person
    amount = BigDecimal(params[:amount])
    if student.checking_account.balance &gt; amount
      if credit_manager.transfer_funds_from_checking_to_savings(student, amount)
        flash[:success] = "Transfer successful."
      else
        flash.now[:error] = "Sorry, something went wrong."
      end
    else
      flash[:error] = "Sorry, not enough money."
    end
    redirect_to bank_path
  end
end
      </code>
    </pre>
  </section>

  <section class='slide'>
    <h2>What was wrong with that?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li class='delayed'>Unrealistic - there are a ton of validations left to do</li>
      <li class='delayed'>Does a bit too much in one place - redirects, user input, validation, etc</li>

    <h2>Next tier rails apps...</h2>
    <p>Often the next level of sophistication in a Rails app looks like this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class='delayed'>Add a StudentTransfer ActiveRecord model</li>
      <li class='delayed'>Validation in the model</li>
      <li class='delayed'>Use an ActiveRecord::Observer to kick off the CreditManager calls</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class='slide'>
    <h2>Next tier rails apps...</h2>
    <p>Complaints</p>
    <ul>
      <li class='delayed'>Really?  Database-backed model for that?</li>
      <li class='delayed'>Callbacks make it hard to see application logic, and easy to break it</li>
      <li class='delayed'>Someone will start reporting on 'the ledger' by reading this table in the database, rather than the ledger.  Trust me...</li>
      <li class='delayed'>ActiveRecord::Observer's gone in Rails 4 because it makes such a mess of codebases</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class='slide'>
    <h2>Commands!!!!1</h2>
    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <ul>
      <li class='delayed'>
        Validation of input can be handled, and tested, painlessly.
      </li>
      <li class='delayed'>
        There is an obvious pattern for building a form to execute the command using typical `form_for` idioms.
      </li>
      <li class='delayed'>
        We will be reusing a custom validator on all transfer commands in the system, so Rails' custom validator framework is very nice.
      </li>
      <li class='delayed'>
        We could easily move to a message based architecture here without missing a beat.
      </li>
      <li class='delayed'>
        Refactoring the bottom layers doesn't affect the controllers at all.
      </li>
      <li class='delayed'>
        Testing a ton of different user interactions can be done entirely at the unit
        test level, with nary a database connection or session setup to be seen.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>We were also trying to adhere to the tell, don't ask philosophy.  We told
    the Command what we'd like to do on success and failure, and then deferred
    to it after execution.</p>

		<h2>More Verbose</h2>
    <blockquote>
    Writing code this way is more verbose in the short run.
    </blockquote>
    <p class='delayed'>
    It's worth it, due to the additional certainty that the code is correct.
    People don't test controllers.  They might integration test the happy path,
    but it's pretty rare to see edge cases covered in controllers.  Drastically
    simpler to handle it in the unit tests, and then just integration test the
    happy path.

      If you mock all of your collaborators, then you aren't really testing your

    </blockquote>
    <p class='delayed'>
    I never said you didn't need to also do integration testing, but if you've
    solidly tested your units then the integration tests (which will always be
    slower) can be a lot more terse and you can test the integration without
    testing the even-slower bits (driving a browser).
